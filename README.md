A little scripts for the Scriptable App on iOS I use

## ‚è∞ Countdown Script

This script allows you to set and display countdowns to important dates directly on your iOS device via widgets using the Scriptable app. It's useful for tracking events, deadlines, or any upcoming occasions. A simple yet effective method to keep yourself accountable.

_Based on [jvscholz's countdown widget](https://github.com/jvscholz/website/blob/master/assets/countdown_widget/countdown.js) and updated to work on the iPhone 16 Pro and various widget sizes_
